Personal Data

My name is Rafid Hoda and I like to be called "Rafid". I was born on January 23rd 1991 in Surat, Gujarat, India. In 1996 I moved to Trondheim, Norway with my family. Since 2016, I have been living in Oslo, Norway. I work as a coding teacher at Scrimba. I've been in love with the computer ever since I started using it at the age of 5. I love building projects.

I have a doctor's appointment on the 17th of November at 13:45.

I have therapy every week on Fridays from 12:00 - 13:00.

I attend the Scrimba Townhall every week on Tuesdays 18:00 - 18:45.

Every Monday we have a Scrimba teacher sync meeting from 17:00 to 17:45. All teachers are required to attend. We share what we did last week and make a plan for the upcoming week.

My day always becomes better whenever I go on a walk outside. I would like to go on a walk every single day.

Christmas is coming up and I need to get gifts for friends and family.

Please remind me to do some coding every single day. Even if it is just for 15 minutes.

I am currently trying to improve what and how I eat. Ideally, I'd like to eat two full meals a day. First meal at around 13:00 and the second one at around 19:00.
